Description:
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it. Check this out.
focused on statement and the title roboto sans and the statement not necessarily on the website, so i checked the robots.txt 
the robots.txt is file that tells search engine crawlers can access on your website. this is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests

in robots.txt i found a text that format with base64

anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==            |base64
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg   |

i try to decode --> anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA <--with base64 decode and this the result is js/myfile.txt
and the flag is in myfile.txt
